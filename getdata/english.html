<h4>Welcome!</h4>
<p>
The radio community is a group. Its purpose is to connect all radio listeners. We will also organize competitions and activities time to time so that the interest of the people remains constant. Although Its main purpose is to avoid the closure of radio programs. We are building an online directory containing a list of radio listeners and radio clubs.  By this initiative, we mean to connect all the radio listeners living in India with each other. All listeners are invited to join the group. Their names and details will be listed on the website. Thank you!
